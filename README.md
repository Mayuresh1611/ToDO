# Tauri + Vanilla JavaScript

# ToDo App

**Overview:**
This ToDo app is built on the Tauri framework to provide a lightweight experience as an alternative to Electron.js. It is programmed in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

### Unique Task Management

Unlike conventional to-do apps, this app combines task management with time goals. You can set a deadline for each task, and when you complete a task, it displays the time at which you finished it. This unique approach enhances productivity by motivating you to complete tasks on time.

### Task Actions

- **Add a Task:** You can easily add a new task by providing a title and specifying the deadline for the task.

- **Edit a Task:** If you need to make changes to a task, you can edit its title and deadline.

- **Mark as Complete:** When you finish a task, you can mark it as complete, and it will record the completion time.

- **Delete a Task:** If you no longer need a task, you can delete it from your list.
